 Came here to se Charlie Murphy. \nParking was nightmare.  I would expect nothing les on  a Saturday night.\nThe 15 minute wait to get inside was torture. They need to implement  a system   Once inside you we were seated pretty quickly.\nSeating is first come first serve.\n\nThe Server was pretty quick to take our orders.  I misread the menu description and didn t realize my BBQ sandwich came \nwith cheese.  I don t eat cheese  and had send my order back. The waiter was gracious and returned with my modified order in about 15 minutes. I ve never heard of throwing cheese pulled pork sandwich  maybe it s  a northern thing. \nWe got our checks quickly  and without issue.  
 Decent  clean  as far as  I could sense in the dim . about on par for   That includes the  10/drink  two-drink minimum  automatic 18  gratuity  and the comic spouting out the obligatory  \"don t forget to tip your waitress.\"\n\nTrying to judge the place on its own merits and not on the entertainment value of the comics.  If the latter  since we were here for Frank Caliendo  I d have given the place the ful  5 stars if only for him alone  \n\nTotal cash bled out of my pocket brought it down from    80 for tickets online included  10 \"service fee\" and tax  we had to: this was  a sold out s  Ad  25 for drinks  gratuity  and more tax. We re talking 3-digits of   for les than  2 hours of entertainment squeezed in between other patrons and glass-wielding servers while you sit on rickety chairs. That s  \n\nWil you se us here again  Probably. but cost makes it unlikely to be  a weekly thing for us.  
 My husband and  I went to do something fun. The comedy was great  The food    In addition  we were seated in the last row  and 10 minutes into the headliner they sat someone else at our table  so that they were in front of us.  I could not se  a thing.    I wil not be returning anytime soon.  
 This was my second visit to the club and it was stil  a blast. My girlfriends bought tickets for John Witherspoon for my bachelorette. We were al looking forward to it and it was hilarious  He was wonderful. \n\nThe servers were fantastic. They always came back to check in on us and make sure we had plenty to eat and drink.  I suggest the Pink Cadillac for  a drink as wel as the cheese cake and chocolate cake for dessert. \n\nThe only reason it isn t  5 stars is because they had us wait an hour past the time we were to enter the building. We were to se the 9pm s  They came out and explained that the s  It was 28 degrees outside. We finally were able to enter the building  order drinks then the s  The host did offer  a blanket apology    
  I have been here twice in the last month. It s  a pretty great time. My first visit  the service was pretty poor and the food was cold by the time it got to the table. We had to sit al the way in the back and the comedian was not that good  although that is no fault of the club . But   The burger  I ordered was fantastic and warm. Our waitres kept the drinks coming without interrupting us while the comedian was on stage. We were also able to sit in the front this time and it was  a great experience. I l be going back soon   
  I love that we have  a great comedy club in Pittsburgh with  a great location at the Waterfront. Perfect for  a date night and  I recommend going to  a later s   I received an online coupon code for  5 tickets for John Heffron.   check for deals before you pay ful price for any s  We went early to pick up the tickets at the ticket office. People were lined up outside about an hour before the s   I had no interest in doing this so we grabbed  a beer acros the street at Rock Bottom. Once they opened the doors  15 minutes before s  It is not huge inside so there aren t really any bad seats. They usually have an MC for the night   This guy was funny and so was the opening act before John Heffron. My only complaint about this place is that they have  a two drink minimum and the prices are outrageous.  9.50 for  a mixed wel drink and  7 for draft beers. The soda was  3.50  Yikes  At least we didn t pay ful price for the tickets.  
 My husband and  I love going to comedy s  Ticket prices aren t bad either.  I am very particular about  \n\nI did have one bad experience    . My husband and  I went to se one of our favorite comedians on  a Thursday night. There is  a two-item minimum  so we decided we would just eat dinner at the s  Well  we were mistaken. First of all  our waitres was rude and slow. After sitting there for  5 or  6 minutes without service she finally comes over and asks   We both order  a drink and food  to    I was annoyed that she even asked  \n\nAt any rate   I order  a Caesar salad and  a beer. It comes out and it s iceburg lettuce with shredded cheese  tomatoes  and other veggies. In other words   a regular salad.  I inform the waitres of this and she seemed totally confused.  I suppose she did not understand the difference    \n\nOverall   I felt that there was no apology for the fact we couldn t eat  let alone everyone else in the place. Salad or dessert aren t the greatest choices    I think the Improv should have waived the two-item minimum on this occasions  even if it cost them money. \n\nAfterwards   I emailed the Improv with my concerns. Never. Heard. Back.\n\nThat being said   I wil most likely return to the Improv..but not for the service. Because it s  a great place to se comedy s  Customer service is terrible.  
 The Waterfront at Homestead is insane  and saves me the trip of driving al the way to Ros Park Mall. Anyway  the Giant Eagle here is enormous  as you d imagine. It s stil  a standard Giant Eagle  aka the best grocery store ever.  
 Waterfront Geagle is my primary market. Now that they ve expanded and reorganized   I rarely even have to set foot in Target anymore. Yippie  There s  a wine kiosk  suck it PA liquor laws   you can buy crazy expensive  6 packs  cheese market  bakery  salad and hot bar  butcher  florist  dry cleaners  international foods  pharmacy  and  a little cosmetics/beauty/bath area. They usually have  a sufficient number of lanes open  and it doesn t get nearly as crowded as Market District.  I do wish  a bulk spice selection was included as part of the expansion  but you can t always get    
 oddly enough  of al the giant eagles  i have visited in pittsburgh  this is the only location that carries the toothpaste that i ve used for most of my life  outside of pittsburgh . the location is clean and the staf are friendly.  i sometimes resent having  a market district being the closest giant eagle to my apartment  as many of the items that  i buy there are severely overpriced. but    
  I drive near this Giant Eagle on my daily commute  so  I shop at this location approximately once/week. The location is pretty  and the beer selection is descent. They carry my favorite lambic  so  I really can t complain  They also have  a very nice health and beauty section. Overall  they usually have the products that  I need.\n\nMy only complaint would be wait time to check out. They never have enough cashiers at peak hours. The store has like 20 checkout lanes  but generally only 5-8 open at  a time.  I always dread checking out  and    
 Just about every you need.\n\nWith great hours   a solid hot bar  sushi  if you re into that    a dry cleaning service  pharmacy  tons of produce  bakery and butchers counter you can t go wrong. Two things that drive me crazy always needing to use my perks card for self check out and the lack of hand carts in the front.  I always have to walk to  a lane and hunt for  a basket then double back  super annoying. \n\nThat said its  a small  and easily repairable  hint  issue that shouldn t keep you from visiting.  
  I find this location  clean and wel organized  but that s not the reason it s getting  5 stars  \n\nI called today to look into whether or not their May issues of magazines were out  I need them for my job  and Erin so kindly went checked on every single magazine  I asked about  \n\nNow that is customer service  \n\nWel done  wel done   
 This bookstore is absolutely packed ful of stuff  They have lots of books   a display of Nooks  DVDs and CDs  miscellaneous items like notebooks and calendars  and  a cafe. Though  a large assortment is nice   I feel like the space is very cramped.  I have purchased  a couple books from here  -   \n\nThe cafe is not very impressive. I ve been pretty underwhelmed by al the food items that I ve purchased here.  I got  a slice of quiche here last night   Not only did they take  5 minutes to microwave it  but it also came out smelling burnt and burning hot. \n\nA little band was singing and playing  a variety of instruments while  I was here.  I wasn t very impressed until  I realized that they were high school kids.  I thought it as really nice that Barnes    Noble would let them perform in the store. and  a great way for B N to get  a lot of their family members in the store  too.  
  I had the EXACT same experience as John R. Went here to get  a quick bite to eat before seeing  a movie acros the street. The place was near empty and there were thre waitresses. Got seated and waited on immediately. Ordered drinks  and it took them 15 minutes to come..no  not alcoholic drinks  two waters and an iced tea. This should have been  a bad sign  but at this point we ordered food.\n\n20 minutes go by..we flag down our waitress  to let her know that we need to get to  a movie in 45 minutes. She said our food would be out in  a few minutes. Another 20 minutes  stil no food  and our waitres is no  We flag down another waitress  she says she wil find our waitress    She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. She says she didn t even realize our food hadn t arrived  well  you never even checked on us  so of course you didn t . After speaking with the kitchen staff  she informs us that she \"definitely\" put our order in so it \"must have been given to someone else by mistake.\" Because they wouldn t have noticed that that WASN T   Seriously \n\nThe waitres told us she could give us our food for take out and  since we were starving  we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later  our food and the bil arrived. Al that was comped was the iced tea  and we got some fre utensils and wetnaps.   We shovelled   Worst part   I opened the wetnap  and it was totally dry. Of course.\n\n  That s because my food     I had the Greek burger and it was huge  cooked exactly    I really wish  I could come back here for the food but..hel no.  
   \n\nNothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staf and hungry patrons.  I very rarely walk out of  a restaurant with out having eaten first.  I came here on Saturday ay 6pm. Almost none of the diners had food on their table and many of them didn t have drinks in the 15 minutes  I was there  I counted  9 waitres again  I counted  9 waitresses and not  a one of them came over to our table to get even  a drink order. Just from the looks of it  I could tel staying any longer would be  a total train wreck. So after 15 minutes of waitres counting we left with empty bellies.  
  I came here last night to get  a few appetizers before  a movie  and was hoping to be able to write  a review on the food. Unfortunately   I cannot because the service was so bad that  I left before  I had the chance to order. We found seats at the bar behind the taps. After sitting there for  5 minutes and not being acknowledged  we thought that they might not be able to se us  and so we moved to  a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar  grabbing  a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. It was fairly busy  but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks  - everyone was seated and I m sure they face much busier times. We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes  I timed it  -  I am not exaggerating   and were not even acknowledged. You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tel us he would be with us    I hope this is  a fluke but wil probably not be back to find out.  
 The absolute worst service  I have ever had at any bar or restaraunt. And  in looking at other reviews   I am not the first. There are many options at the Waterfront  and  I would suggest you try any of them; but stay far away from this place   
 Servers are chatting  not paying attention to tables.  I can se my salad is ready at the window. Worst serves ever.  
 Man  haters gonna hate. Listen  y all  Bar Louie isn t fancy. It s just not and their extensive martini list won t fool me.   The staf has been nothing but nice even   As long as Bar Louie stil keeps having  1 Burger Days  Tuesdays  and  1 Beer Days  Wednesdays    I wil continue to be  a fan. FYI  It s  a fanatically cheap movie    dinner/drinks weekday date spot.  
 Eh  this place was okay but it was sort of  a weird crowd/overal experience for  a Saturday night.\n\nBobby and  I came here after dinner and sat up at the bar. Tip: if you sit behind the taps  no one wil bother to acknowledge you exist.   It wasn t al that busy  either. Most of the people sitting at the bar were  a bit older than we were. It seems that Bar Louie is trying to hard to be trendy with the decor/neon blue lighting/extensive martini list. Maybe I m just salty about the wait.  
 The evites are in the mail for the  2 for  9 special  You wil have to spend  24 on  a parking pass.  I signed up last year for this promotion and don t think  I got the passes worth. \n\nThe waterpark is nice and lounging by the pool or floating around the lazy river is perfect for  a hot summer day. There are just to many misses in my book though.\n\n1st of al Traffic is  a biatch  Be ready to sit on browns hil rd for  a very long time unles you leave before 9am and wait for the park to open at 10am. \n\nNext remember it is  a family park so there wil be lots of rude and bratty kids al over the place.  I m not  a mean kid hater  my experiences have been bad at the Sandbar pool. \n\nIf you do arrive early enough you wil be standing in the hot sun with  a gang of kids that WIL push you out of the way and run to claim 10 chairs with towels even though they won t use them because they run around the park al day.  I actually got into an argument last summer with one said kid.  I was like \"I m an adult and you need to have some respect.\" He pushed me and took al the chairs.  I only needed one and his mother did not correct him.  I was on fire and moved  a chair over from the back and he stil was giving me crap because  I moved the chairs over..THAT NO ONE was even there to sit in at the time. Damn  FOR REAL \n\nSandbar drinks are expensive and incredibly weak. Plus they are so sugary. If you do get  a frozen drink and sit by the pool be prepared for it to be half pool water in  a few minutes. An Adult area would change al this.  I don t even care that I m getting splashed al the time  I do realize that I m at  a pool but it s hard to relax.\n\nIf you do get  a pas have  a friend   If you re trying to go on the weekend forget it  The weekdays are bad enough. I m looking for  a better pool side lounge for this summer.  
 Dont waste your time with this place. Long lines  overpriced and no shade or cooling spots while you wait. Half the \"rides\" were shut down. You re better of with  a garden hose. Save your money or buddy up to someone with  a pool.  
 This is the most reliable car service  I have experienced in Pittsburgh. Amazing service. For the last four years  we have used them each week to pick up and drop of colleagues at the airport. They re always waiting by the Hertz counter  ahead of time  without fail. Even   They charge about  10 more than  a yellow cab. If you have client you need picked up or dropped of at the airport   I would highly recommend First Class. \n\nMy first time in Pittsburgh     
  I agre with the other reviewers.  I tried these guys based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. \n\nI m  a grumpy New Englander  and have been frustrated by the smal town  easygoing/careles customer service at many PGH businesses. These guys are different: professional  punctual  even in snow  .  
 Great customer service.  I was in Pittsburgh for busines and needed  a car to get back to the airport.  I found these guys on Yelp  and the reviews were not wrong. It was easy to order the car and pick-up was prompt.  
 Other people may have had  a better experience with this company but that was not the case for us. We had rented  a limo/bus for  a bachelor party. Our driver Scott  was completely clueles in navigating the city. Constantly making wrong turns and missing exits. Al of this after very thorough instruction as to   Each destination took 3-4 times longer to reach due to his incompetence. This caused us to have to skip  a couple of our originally planned stops. After returning to the bus after one of our stops we were informed by Scot that the police had come onto the bus and searched it with dogs. Really              We found that our bags had been rifled through and we al felt  a little violated and confused. By this point we decided to cal it  a night. More than half of our passengers didn t care to step back onto the bus and took cabs home. \n\nJust   As we enter the highway we realize that Scot has driven al the way up the ramp and onto the highway going THE WRONG WAY  He starts slowly reversing down the ramp while oncoming cars honk and swerve al around us  Truly terrifying. After that  we were very upset and just wanted to get home. So after several more wrong turns we finally get home. Absolutely terrible night. \n\nSo if you d like to book  a party bus that wil include  a geographically blind driver  unecessary police involvement   a near death experience and just an overal sense of frustration mixed with panic then go with these guys. Otherwise   I would suggest staying far  far away   
 Awful everything. From the bad service  to the diluted soup  to the lame-no chicken on the chicken salad  to the PRE-fabricated pizza. AVOID THIS PLACE   
 Food was ok had  a steak w/ shrimp side As mashed potatoes. Everything was ok not  a lot of flavor.  
  I think the location in homestead has ruined this place. Dirty dirty dirty.\n\nBathrooms unkept  entry door handle and windows filthy\n\nPizza had to much sauce on it and was drenched. Server was coarse  not refined\n\nServing items were old and rusty. Temperature of food was not hot\n\nLow quality  but probably ok with pittsburgher  s  
 My friend and  I have never eaten here before so last night we decided to check it out. For  a Thursday it wasn t that crowded and we were seated promptly. There were plenty of flat screens and warm lighting that made the place cozy. We ordered  a thin crust pizza: on one side there was chicken  hamburger and pepperoni  for him  while the other side had just pepperoni  for me .  I was expecting the pizza to be bland and warm but it was surprisingly hot and savory.  I even tried  a slice of my friend s pizza and the hamburger and chicken were moist  not dried out. This wasn t bad for  a first visit so  I wil definitely be back in the future to try more menu items. I m only giving Uno  4 stars because the waitres brought us  a plate that stil had old food stuck to it. Hello  The plate was yellow      
 Interesting the reviews here are les than stellar already.  I would normally not review  a chain retail store  but the service  I received today just really got my blood boiling.\n\nI wil state  as  I always do in these types of situations  that  I have worked many years in retail.  I know    I know the ways I ve displayed exemplary service and  I know the ways I ve slacked off.  I get it   I really do.\n\nSo I m in the store early. Hardly any people in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn t matter   \n\nI went through my usual bins and picked up  a mes of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and  I needed  a spot to go through things   I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick.  I actually always like to do this  just to shoot the breeze  but also to get their opinions on items I m buying. \n\nThe girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about  a bra and she said she didn t know about that one  but said it should work.  I understand  you can t try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter.  I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one.\n\nSo I m going through my stuf and separating   \" Um  I m not asking you to help me sort things. I m not holding up  a line. I m just trying to not spend   on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in  \n\nAfter that  it s not exactly    I have never felt more uncomfortable in  a retail store before.  I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself    \n\nThe thing is   I was nice the entire time.  I don t expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do   Be nice and sel some bras. If you come to work in  a bad mood  the real world is not going to give you  a hug. Suck it up and do your job or work    
 Wasn t terrible \nBut certainly wasn t great.\nSave your hard-earned cash.  
 Honestly  I m furious.  I enjoyed PF Chang s restaurants in the Chicago area  and my wife and  I have eaten  a few times at this Pittsburgh-area location. Over the last year  we have tried repeatedly  but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. We tried going early  late - it never made any difference. The front staf was rude  and the wait was to long.\n\nTonight  we had  a special date planned  and made reservations  a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time  waited in the line to se the front staff  and we were promptly handed  a pager. They couldn t tel us  \n\nI imagined  a short wait  so we went outside  crossed into  a store to wait  since the entrance of this location is so packed  it s impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating .\n\nAfter 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang s and the front office staf stil couldn t tel us    I saw open tables.\n\n \n\nThe food here is good  but certainly not great. We went to  a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in  5 minutes. The food was much better  the service was good even in  a crowded busy restaurant. Oh  and the local place was  a much more reasonable price.\n\nWe certainly wil never visit PF Chang s again.  
 My vegan friend  Deb  turned me onto the fact that one can dine at PF Chang s and stay on  a vegan diet.\n\nVegan friend Deb  VFD  asked the waitres if they could prepare  a version of the famous chicken and lettuce wraps. The waitres without hesitation proclaimed they always had  a vegan version  but it was never put on the menu.\nWarning: even though it s vegan  it stil contains the same amount of salt that was reported on al the news channels   The vegan version is just as delicious and the chicken.\n\nThey also have vegan dishes like string beans and garlic  eggplant and garlic  and  a few dishes with tofu and vegetables.\n\nI always loved the fact PF Chang s offered brown rice. That nutty flavor goes so wel with their meals.\n\nThe service staf at Chang s is always top shelf  I ve never had  a bad time here and love    
 LOVE the food  Try the bomb pop martini. The service has definitely Gone down hil in the past year. And   It s either hit Or mis with service. But food is ALWAYS GOOD  
 The service was lackluster. Coffe was warm but delicious. Limited to one cup  apparently  as the waitres never offered  a second.\n\nDaughter had sweet and sour shrimp. Wife had spicy chicken.  I had wonton soup. Dumplings as an appetizer for the table. Al arrived warm. The brown rice was dry as sand and the white rice was delayed by rice cooker problems. Also dry as sand.  I gues that is  \n\nThe base flavors for the shrimp and chicken were nearly identical.  I had expected them to be more diverse. \n\nIn all  expectations were not met for   I d rather have the local Chinese cuisine    
 This was my first time at this PF Chang s and  I was not impressed. The service was extremely slow even though it was  a Sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy. The portions were small. \n\nThey were also playing  5 year old pop music really loud. Pop music   Come on--this is an \"Asian Bistro.\"  
  I really enjoyed my Mongolian beef and pork pot stickers  but \nThere was NO presentation of pfc mixing sauces. \nOne of the things that sets pfc apart from the run of the mil Non franchise is PRESENTATION and experience.  I was extremely disappointed by the LACK of presentation. \n\nReservations:\nOur party arrived about 15 minutes before our 5:30 reservations.\n\nAt 6:1 we were informed our reserved table had been given to another party  . Obviously someone dropped the bal here..\n\n  Our waitres blamed it on the hostess. Yes  theHostes should have provided silverware.   As  a Patron  I could care les   Defiantly took away from my pfc experience.\n\nMy Hot and sour soup is usally served with\"noodley\" things that  I drop in the soup. We weren t given any \"noodley \" things  . Not trying to be  a jerk but al things being equal the pfc isn t selling food as much as they are selling an experience. This experience is    
 Our last few visits have left something to desire  One of the things  I always notice is the demeanor of an establishments employees. These people look miserable  no one smiles or greets you appropriately  it s more like get in  get out  turn the tables \n\nThe food has remained consistently good.   the last time JB and  I came for  a quick dinner  the place was not busy yet we were passed by  6 frowning waitstaf without getting drinks. for 15 minutes we were left suiting at our table with our menus closed and sitting on the edge of the table  HINT  HINT  so we left and most likely wil not be returning.  
 If you look at other reviews you wil se that  I am  a very positive person  but tonight was an utter disaster  We sat at the bar and the female bartender was miserable. We ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did. She spent 20 minutes sending text messages and took  3 smoke brakes in one hour while our drinks were empty. We ordered appetizers and they never came out. She actually brought us our check and we never got our food. By the way we were the only people at the bar. Finally  a bus boy brought us our food after we payed. We payed before our food came because we thought our table was ready. We finally got seated by the windows. Do not sit by the windows because it was very cold. We ordered our dinner and drinks and gues   After our food came we asked about our drinks and the waiter said he forgot. Nothing was comped and no manager was available. This PF Changs needs new management  We wil never return.  I wil give it  2 stars because the food was great  but the employees are absolutely miserably from hostes to waiters to bartenders. Steer clear until changes are made. It s not worth the headache.  
 Came out here with my parents to have dinner.  I have to say that our meal was al around worth  a  4 star rating  but the lousy attitude of the hostes and the man behind the desk   \n\nOur food was pretty good. The lettuce wraps are usually my favorite part  and this time it was no different. My mom s fried fish peices and veggies was also delicious.   there was seriously no taste at all  and it was tiny   I found myself adding al the extra sauces on the table just to try to give it some dang flavoring.\n\nIf  I was you   I would order lettuce wraps for an ap and lettuce wraps for your meal. If you have room  lettuce wraps for dessert  too. Oh yeah  and to drink  lettuce wraps.  
 Rude unwelcoming short haired black hostess. Drinks were not good. Greasy spring rolls \n\nBelow par on every way. No experience needed to work here  
 The service started out slow  but they eventually picked up the pace. We ordered the chicken/lettuce wrap appetizer  and we enjoyed it. For the entres  we had the fried rice and mongolian beef  both of    I would not mind going back to explore their menu.  
  I seriously don t know   The rice is never cooked properly. And it s not even Asian food. It s fake asian food.  I never come here anymore.  
 We went last night Saturday night to P.F.Chang located at the Kierlands in Scottsdale. Terrible Experience  after waiting over one hour to be seated  we ordered calamari for appetizer   then  I ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered  a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce  . After  a long wait my food came so salty that  I could not even eat and as much as  I hate to complain but  I had to let the waiter know  so he went to get me one with les salt. My husband s dish was OK. then the second one was  a bit les salty but the meat had  a terrible liver kind of taste    I feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. Very bad experience. Our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :   
 Let me start of by saying  I have mostly simple tastes  and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations   I was forced to try something new.\n\nSo.  I thought I d try the chain PF Chang s Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow   \n\nI started with  a cup of their Wonton soup. At  2.95 it wasn t to outrageous of  a price  the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than  I was used to  including thre giant basil  I think   leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken  two shrimp  some sliced water chestnuts and two \"pork\"-filled wontons. As  I said  the broth had decent flavor  but the wontons were thick  doughy and under-cooked  and the chicken chunks were dry    On  a scale of bad to good  it was kind of meh.\n\nNext came my \"lunch-portion\" order of Chang s Kung Pao Chicken  the dinner portion is  5 more . \n\nAt the New Dumpling House  this dish is served with  a delectable dark  rich  tangy sauce    Not at PF Chang s. \n\nOn my plate  I received about  8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken   7 hot Chinese red chili peppers  mostly inedible unles they are diced into  a sauce    a handful of blanched  unsalted peanuts   a few sliced scallions  and  a bed of the most bland brown rice  I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would ve been ashamed if that stuf came out of one of his boxes.\n\nGlaringly  there was NO SAUCE . None at all.\n\nI ve had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City  San Francisco  and even from  a hole in the wal in Bethel Park  PA that was much  much better. Never have  I had it served in such  a bland  skimpy  and overpriced way  The \"lunch-portion\" cost was  9.95.\n\nAt The New Dumpling House   I could have  a delicious lunch  with soup  entre and complimentary hot tea  and  I could leave satisfied with just  8 out-of-pocket - and that includes the tip.\n\nThe service was decent.   One and done. Never going back to PF Changs.  
 I m not really into chain restaurants but my mom s in town so. You know. \n\nThe mains are basically  a half notch classier than  a Chinese take out but I m just not impressed.  15 for  a smal portion of orange chicken that is about as good as  a cheap takeout seems silly. \n\n  The salad lacks any creativity and the soup was just  a bowl of salty beef water.  
 Our family loves this restaurant. My children and  I suffer from food allergies.  I have Celiac s Disease and their gluten fre selection for  a Chinese restaurant is great. My children are  a completely different bal game. They have  a rare disease called Eosinophilic Esophagitus   They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten  soy  eggs  dairy  nuts  tre nuts  fish  shellfish  amd corn. This restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the eg wash. The servers and managers are al trained in   Our favorite manager is Joe and favorite server is Kevin. Cal ahead if you have any questions and they wil answer your questions.  
  I really enjoy Panera  and this restaurant meets my expectations.  I particularly love the Asiago Cheese Bagel  Caesar Salad  Bacon Turkey Bravo Sandwich  Tuna Salad Sandwich  Smokehouse Turkey Panini  Broccoli Cheddar Soup  and Iced Chai Tea Latte. I ve ordered al of these items at this location  and they have been very tasty.\n\nI have had this location run out of the side of French Baguette once or twice.  \n\nI l definitely be returning soon   
 Panera bread has to be the most inconsistent restaurant  I have ever been to.  I have posted two pictures of the strawberry poppyseed chicken salad. The first one looks delicious the second one looks like they could ve used  a smaller bowl. It did not even look appetizing.  
 The food was fine. It s  a chain. I m not rating it. \n\nThe service was absolutely horrible. It started wel enough   \n\nBetween being ignored by the girl at the counter  her not listening to the order  then arguing with me    I rather spend my money some   
 The problem  I have this experience compared to my last is that the examination lasted  3 minutes. The vet checked the ears  teeth  and nails then called it  a day. \n\nI came home looked at his teeth and saw my pup had  a \"slab fracture\"   The vet didn t mentioned it during the \"exam\" other than telling me to buy  a finger brush to brush his teeth.\n\nI was primarily there for  a vaccination shot but if they re going to charge me for  a examination  they should do  a proper examination.  I just felt  I was rushed out of there. \n\nI took my dog to another vet    
   Like another reviewer says  you have to watch the impulse buying here because it is so easy to do \n\nBut as for the name brands here  I ve never had  a problem with them.  I bought some Woolrich blankets and sheets here that my husband and  I have been very satisfied with. The housewares section here is positively unbeatable. My husband Rick is an amateur chef and he could blow his paycheck on the kitchen utensils. He particularly likes the Michael Graves ones. He is also an amateur photographer and he stil works with film  so he likes the film development here.\n\nMe   I also like buying household cleaners and personal items such as soaps  toothpaste  deoderant  etc because the selection is so good. I ve also purchased  a lot of my casual wear here.  
  I was in and out  and  I didn t wait in long to long so I m happy.  
 It s not that delish.  
  I got pizza here on  a Saturday night in  a pinch. Looking for  a place that sells by the slice   I drove around for  a while. Not only did they have by-the-slice pizza  but they also had some of my favorite toppings.  I also hate crust that s to thick  and - although  I prefer it even thinner than it was -  I was pretty satisfied with the crust. \n\nThe only thing that could be improved is the salad. We got  a grilled chicken salad. The chicken and fries were okay  but the rest was pretty run of the mill.\n\nAs for the pizza  I l definitely be back for more.  
 This store has such bad service. The service staf are rude rude rude. Save your money  shop else   
 We had the worst possible experience at the Eat  N Park at Waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. Our waitres  Annemarie  was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with  a dish we had not even ordered and stil got charged for it on the check. \n\nOne of my friends ordered  a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich    But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients.     \n\nSpoke to the manager after paying the ful check and first of all  she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order  and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. \n\n    Even your online menu says under the description for  a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients  - \"Served with lettuce and tomato on  a fresh-baked Kaiser roll.\"  - That s   Shame on you Manager for lying  Instead of admitting her fault  she was blaming it to  a new menu \n\nNot only did we have to pay for something that we didn t order or eat  but we got sub-standard food that was different from   \n\nI am never going to come back to any Eat  N Park location ever again  and wil never recommend one to any of my friends either.   Plus dealing with callous and lying people  - my goodness   I surely had my patience tested this evening   
 Much like every other Eat  n Park  3 or  4 stars worth of chain-diner food   except the last five times I ve been here  the service has been damn  damn  daamn slow. It s always fun to se the staf smoking out back while I ve waited an hour for some scrambled eggs.  
 God  i hate eat  n park. Only reason  i have gone is for the salad bar because  u cant find  a decent salad bar in this city. Just about every entre iv had here is nothing more than rubbish  except maybe the cheesteak. Only go if  u have little kids  
 Went in here to grab  a last minute item  I needed for an outfit.  I wasn t going to hold my breath here either   I know it s  a Marshalls and that doesn t always mean the best selection. It s hit or mis no matter  \n\nThis day  was  a hit  maybe even  a home run.  I do have to admit  the Kenneth Cole shirt  I got not only looked great on me  but made my wallet feel even better   
 No pictures   I knew  I should have taken my camera \n\nMy aunt and  I went there today for Mother s day.  I think we must have gotten the lunch menu because everything looked pretty cheap  I ve been to the one in Columbus . My aunt had  a chicken dinner  grilled chicken  green beans and potatoes with butter  and  I had their Shanghai sampler   We didn t order dessert since my aunt had made my favorite pumpkin pie  Anyway  dinner was great  and so was the service  thus the five stars   
  I was impressed. \n\nWent here for lunch. The seafood gumbo was tremendous.  I wasn t in the mood for more seafood so  I had the chicken blt on ciabatta bread. I m not sure   Wil go back again.\n\nThe food was reasonably priced for lunch. Dinner would obviously be more expensive but  I imagine it s worth the  .  
 I m not  a mean reviewer  if you look at the other places I ve reviewed  but this was just so so so disappointing. The Shanghai style Merlin was very poorly done. The meat was extremely bland  with very little seasoning.  I have  a very low sodium tolerance and yet  I stil found this fish to be made to bland. The rice was entirely uncooked and it made crunching sounds as  I took my first bite.  I talked to the waitres and she offered to bring out another side. It wasn t the same. The whole dish was  a fail and  I don t think  I am ever coming back again :   
  I have always had  a great dinner at Mitchell s but something has changed. Went there last night about 5:30  the place was maybe half full. We were seated and   14 minutes later we decided to leave. Told the hostes   Sorry but not going back there again.  
 Amazing valentines dinner and service  Curt was simply  a wonderful server and the food was fantastic. \n\nOnly negative was  a few overly salted bites. But as someone   That could purely be my palate only.  
 The tuna was enjoyable and the service was prompt. The house Chardonnay was buttery and was  a good compliment to the fish. It was  a Tuesday night so the place was busy but not crowded. Since  I wasn t \"wowed\" by the place  I won t give it  5 stars but  I had no dissatisfaction to speak of.  I wil be back  if I m not acros the street at the Rock Bottom Brewery .  
 We went here for Thanksgiving dinner; we had called ahead to check out vegan options  but the person on the other end was  a little grumpy about the matter  but there s so little open on that day  there was little choice except to make sure  I ate  a big lunch earlier.\n\nI ordered the Thai salad     I also ordered some grilled vegetables. Both were good  but not amazing. \n\nThe beer selection was really bad  I mean  dive bar stuff     \n\nThe service to was pretty good  but  I simply can t recommend going here due to the poor selection of vegan items.  
 I m not to impressed with this particular Dick s Sporting Goods. It is in  a great location in the Waterfront  but the selection seems  a bit limited to me. They have  \n\nI went in there the other day and it looks like they also have  a snowboarding section now    They also have hunting  golfing and biking  in addition to the other regular deptartments. \n\nYour normal Dick s. Nothing spectacular  but it wil do.  
 You know it s bad  .I mean  seriously: none of us expect anything fancy   The   In my case   I just wanted  a smal meal/snack that wouldn t cost me as much as the stuf in Kennywood would.  I hadn t even eaten at  a McDonald s in about eight years or so. And  I quickly remembered  \n\nForget the fact that McDonald s food isn t great. We al know it s not great. The problem here is that they added insult to injury by giving you the worst customer service ever in addition to not so good food. For starters   I quickly discovered that the drive-thru here is the ABSOLUTE slowest line on planet Earth. You certainly won t be getting any fast food here  Then  once  I FINALLY placed my order  and finally got to the window to pay  because of course  I spent  a lot of time waiting for the people in front of me to even get their orders    a young woman took my card  swiped it..and didn t say another word.  I waited thinking she was printing  a receipt  - nope  Eventually  - after whipping out her phone and sending  a text or two  - she realized  I was stil there and told me to go to the next window for my food.   On to the next window   .and  I proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason  layered my Big Mac as such: bread  bread  patty  patty  bread. ..seriously     I give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty good..but they were not worth the wait or trouble.\n\nI concur with the other reviewers: skip this place. Completely. Just keep driving. Any   
 By far the absolute worst Mcdonalds in the\nWorld. You can pretty much rest assured that  after your long wait in the drive thru  your order wil most definitely be wrong. Calls to the owner go ignored. Rice Enterprises own  a majority of the McDonalds in the South Hills. They have al gone down hil in quality  service and cleanliness. The owner has to be the problem.  
  I wrote this review right after  I had bought my bike.  I would like to update to reflect further experiences I ve had with BB.\n\nSo  first of all  one of the shifters on my bike turned out to be defective  not super-unusual for the Shimano short-reach shifters  also totally not the shop s fault - these things happen . Since it was covered under warranty  B switched it out for  a new set of shifters  at no cost to me.  I had my bike back in  a couple days  no mus no fuss.\n\nMy husband got  a used road bike from Craigslist  and we brought it in for  a tuneup. The bike had several things wrong with it  due to  a shoddy assembly job  and B basically took the entire bike apart and rebuilt it  cleaning it and replacing various worn-out bits.  I can t remember the total cost of this  but it was under  100.\n\nI would totally recommend BB  due to their general awesomeness.  I haven t had any of the tuneup-related woes that other people have had with this shop  even    
 This place makes AWESOME pizza. Also  their Italian hoagies are great. The only problem is that they do not open until 4.  
 This is my favorite bakery.  I always get great service and have never been disappointed with anything. Their toasted almond torte is to die for.  I AM ALWAYS POLITE TO THEM  MAYBE THAT S WHY  I GET GREAT SERVICE   
 You have never had  a pierogie until you ve driven out to McKees Rocks and picked up  a dozen or so from Pierogies Plus. Made primarily by Polish and Ukranian immigrants  these are probably the most authentic/delicious pierogies you can buy in the states. \n\nIf the only pierogies you ve ever had were the frozen Mrs. T s you got at Giant Eagle  do yourself  a favor and check Pierogies Plus out.  
 In Pittsburgh  there IS no other place to get pierogies. Everything is made by hand  fresh every day. And the mix of languages while you wait is  a real treat  There are over 30 kinds of pierogies and now that they have expanded  there are  a variety of salads and some desserts available too. Don t forget about the haluski and stuffed cabbage  They ve been on the Food Network with Bobby Flay  Food Finds  Dave    Dave from WQED  and in numerous newspaper articles. You won t find anything more authentic or delicious as this place. And they ship too   
 As  a skeptical out of towner   I was pretty wary after the hotel bellhop suggested this of the beaten path place.   We bought an assorted dozen of pierogies and they were al delicious  my favorites being the jalape\u00f1os pierogi and the bacon/potato pierogi .  A great find and an excellent place for someone out of town to try out pierogies   
 Great food   I have been eating at Pierogies Plus since they opened. Great food al around  The Halupki and Halushki are awesome as wel as the Pierogies.  
 It wasn t  a busy night at the neighborhood  but you could have been fooled by   While it did take  a while everyone was extremely friendly. The food did come out hot  at least mine did  the rest of the plates were plate-warmer hot. Everyone in the table resented me for \"holding back\" the table since they staf pointed out they were waiting on my burger.\n\n  Quesadilla Burger.  I knew that was  a mistake but  I did it anyways. The patty was sorta flavorful. The toppings were in the bland category. Cheese went MIA. And the tortilla were over-toasted and tasteless.\n\nA big blah overall     
 The pizza here is great.  I always pick up  a pizza    I have only ever eaten their pizza.  
  I stopped by here two nights ago as part of  a night    I called my order in for an XL pizza ahead of time and was told that  I would have  a 15 minute wait until it was ready. Since  I only had  a general idea of   There isn t to much to say about the inside of this pizza place except that they have  a counter up front with  a little bit of room to wait and no customer seating  not that this is  a bad thing.\n\nPizzas in general can be broken down into thre separate components: cheese  crust and sauce. This pizza actually had the least amount of cheese on it of al of the pizzas that we tried but ended up being my favorite   The cheese was not that strong in flavor but the amount of it let it pair perfectly with the sauce    coming through it. The crust on this pizza was the thinnest of the bunch that we tried and was cooked nicely   \n\nThe bottom line for me is that  I would head back to  R    B s again in the future for pizza. It was easily the most expensive of the bunch that  I bought last night at  12.79 after tax for an XL but as the old adage goes \"You get    
 Get the white pizza with bacon. You re life wil never be the same. Never had  a bad experience ordering from R B s.  
  I stopped by here this past Tuesday in order to pick up  a to go pizza. My fiance   a friend and  I were trying pizza from thre different places and Luigi s was one of them.  I have driven by Luigi s many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind      I arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused   You se there was  a large dining room on the left that was ful of people and  I didn t immediately se the are   Finally after  a few steps into the restaurant  I noticed that the   My pizza was ready for me and  I quickly paid and was leaving    I really hope that was  a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else. The pizza itself had  a medium thick crust with  a bland sauce   The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had  a slightly sour taste to it   Out of the thre different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite  \n\nThe bottom line for me is that  I wil probably not head back to Luigi s in the future.  I just don t se myself making  a trip to Luigi s between the weird experience  although not bad  that  I had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby.  
 Recently I ve found myself patronizing Bellevue  a little more  namely because I ve bought  a house in the area  and have been checking out some of the mom and pops along the little strip of Mayberry RFD that is the quaint main street. Luigi s is one of those little mom and pops that offers standard basic Italian in  a comfortable setting. It s  a little kitchy  red-white-and-green  with Dino and Frankie tunes playing in the background.\n\nI ve stopped in on several occasions now for dinner  with various friends  and the food has been consistent..it s good..satisfying. Not over-the-top gourmet  or even in the remotest sense  pretentious . It s just  a good ol  night out for some pasta or lasagna  with  a side salad  garlic bread and conversation with your pals.\n\nThe portions are ample  the prices are reasonable  the flavors won t knock your socks of and make you think you ve died and gone to Sicily  but they won t make you cringe at having given your money to  a profiteering Chef Boyarde either. The service is decent  kind of point blank  not rude  nor over the top friendly. \n\nThe crowd can fluctuate between  Oh my god  I m surrounded by Hillbillies  to  the local gathering at Mayberry   but that seems to be the norm for most places in da burgh.\n\nI ve not had the pizza    But I ve had thre or four of the pasta dishes  and they come in  a generous portion  with  a side salad and an order of garlic toast. They taste fine  fil you up  and don t break your bank.\n\nAnd for  a local neighborhood joint  that s exactly    A place you can go to find  a dependable and reasonable meal  on  a semi-regular basis  in  a comfortable setting  with no frills or pretense. \n\nAnd that is exactly    
  I have never gotten an order correct from this specific McDonald s. I m not sure   It is never quick. The staf is always rude. After trying at least 12-15 times over the past year  I ve finally given up hope on this place. Do not recommend.  
 My orders have come out bad pretty much every time  I have ordered from here. The chicken nuggets come out under par. I m lucky if the fries come out right. My last experience is the last straw.  I recently posted  a photo of my Chicken Ranch Club. That has no chicken. This is ridiculous.  I am done going to this Mcd s.  
 Delivery is slow and not even close to the best Chinese in the area. No matter if it s rice or noodles or chicken or pork  everything tastes off--like it s been overcooked in mop-bucket-water. Try House of Le instead.  
 Wow.   My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are  a very large family and love foods of al kind. We ve eaten Chinese food from  a hundred different places in  a dozen different cities. Hands down  this was the worst we ve ever had. Cold  tough  congealed  and tasteles  - that s the only way to describe it. I l never order from here again. Quite frankly  the fact that  I took time away from my kids to type this out should tel you   My complaints fel on deaf ears.  I gues they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food.  I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But   Not at this place.  I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me.  I gues that s   To bad. Because we wil be visiting  a competitor in the future. This family of  7 won t be visiting China Sea ever again. Oh  and by the way     
 If you have any common sense at all  please don t stay here. Once  it almost burnt down..and I m pretty sure most of the locals were chanting \"burn  baby  burn.\"  
 Horrifying. This place should be ashamed of itself. DO NOT STAY HERE. Beyond dirty  just absolutely rank.  
  I got  a pedicure here. Not bad  they were pretty thorough. But two days later both of my big toes were infected and oozing pus    I hate to rate  a local shop down  but man my toes hurt.  
 This is my favorite  event  restaurant  by   It is great for intimate birthdays  celebrations  etc.   \n\nBut more importantly the food. Oh  the food  The owner/chef takes so much care  it makes the    I have never had  a bad meal. \n\nI  
 My boyfriend and  i went here last night. the restaurant is dark romantic and the decor is amazing. There are photographs of the owners and chefs family on the walls. its cute. My boyfriend called ahead and told them  i was vegetarian and the chef prepared  a couple of things for me. There is no set menu and the waitres reads out   an appetizer  pasta  main course   a salad and and dessert.  I thought the salad after the entre was pretty interesting  . They are also very generous with the bread   \nEvery meal was made to perfection. It had  a homey feeling ..\nMy boyfriend had some scallops that he is stil talking about. My entre was spaghetti squash with mushroom wild rice and berries and limed artichokes. There were so many flavors and al the ingredients were balanced. The service was great.\n Al in al it was an amazing experience. The chef came out to say hi at the end of the night.  i finished of my dinner with the creme brule and some coffee. Our bil came to  120 with tip and it was absolutely worth it .\nThis is  a great restaurant for  a super special occasions and it is very private.Not to dressy and not to casual.\n Pick out  a great bottle of wine or two and get ready to get your taste buds blown.\n Im pretty sure my boyfriend and  i wil be going back.  
 STAY AWAY  the owners are so rude  they blatantly say they are not doing wel and then try to pretend they have the best hairdressers in Pittsburgh. they make you feel so unwelcome  advertise they offer  a bunch of services and then   it was so awkward and weird  .  i received warnings not to get my hair done there so  i was going to get  a pedicure because  i had  a gift certificate. she told me her employees wil only take cash if they have to touch  a client s feet.  I may go there just to get bangs trimmed since  i do not want to completely waste the certificate  but this place gives me the creeps  sounds dirty  and has beyond bad customer service. They definitely do NOT know   Sue and Kristi pas the phone back and forth because noone wants to take  a call. she reiterates that the busines is doing bad and they need more clients.  i have never experienced  a ruder salon  or should  i say dead beat shack.  
 Let me just tel you   I have really  really difficult hair. type 3b Naturally curly  100  grey   I dye it dark and mes with the color myself.    never good  If you want to know   Since  I have been going to Mane Attractions  I have really LOVED my hair.  I have been going there for about  4 years. Kristi was even able to cut my curly hair into  a short reverse bob without making me look like  i was wearing  a helmet.    you curly girls know    I have had nothing but complements on my hair and even my mom    The only complaint  I ever have is that yes  sometimes  I have gone there on the spur of the moment and it has been closed during the week.  I just know to cal and schedule things. it is  a smal busines and  I get it. P.S. kids haircuts are only 10  and My daughter loves it.  
 Got  a key lime pie from this place. It was horrid. Icing was stale cake thick  crust was not even crunchy or had taste  and the key lime was weak. Pie looked it it was sitting out for  a day or 2.  
 Everytime  I eat at this location  I end up with  a sick stomach.  I don t have that problem at other Arby s. The dining area is clean and everything else seems ok but  I always get  a sick stomach. Maybe they should relook at their food prep.  
  I cannot imagine  a more miserable place to shop than this jam-packed monstrosity. This is  a store that makes me thankful for Goodwil and The Salvation Army resale stores. The customers and the staf are miserable at Red White and Blue. The clothes are priced far higher than other such shops. Merchandise is not refundable or exchangeable  and there are no fitting rooms  One purchases clothes at their own risk    Unlike other stores  there is no senior discount and no credit cards accepted   a rare cash only business. To the reviewer   It is bogus pricing. Red White and Blue  uggh   
 Prices not great for true thrifters. Staf completely useless. No dressing rooms.  I simply have nothing to say about this place.  
 Rating this store is tough because  I want to give it  a 5..I really do.\nHuge selection of clothing  housewares  electronics and furniture  but NO FITTING ROOMS \n\nYes  you read that correctly. No fitting rooms. Are you kidding me     It doesn t completely overshadow the fact that they have great items  but  \n\nThe clothing is organized by style and color  not by size  so be ready to dig. Same thing with the shoes.\n\nI asked  a staf member    I was slightly confused for  a minute and then realized that was my only option.  I decided against even peeking at any pants or blouses and instead went for jackets and sweaters  I could easily try on over my shirt. \n\nNow  the mirrors are directly side-by-side  so if there are two people trying things on over their clothes  so weird   you re going to be right up on top of them. Not to mention you l be right on top of people browsing through the kitchen section.\n\nA lady  I was chatting with told me that she has seen women come in wearing tight fitting shirts/tank tops and spandex tights  hey  those are some   so they are able to easily try everything on over their clothing  stil weird .\n\nAs annoyed as  I was about the fitting room situation   I wil probably make  a trip out there again in the future to browse based solely on the size of the store.  I just might have to wear some spandex.  
 The home-cooked breakfasts at The Rusty Nail in Bellevue are wonderful  prices are reasonable  the wait staf are gems  and is often bragged about by Bellevue locals. That said  two stars is al  I can muster primarily due to the tiny  cramped dining area. I ve witnes people at thre tables being disrupted while they are eating so departing diners would have enough room to push their chair away from the table and pas by others just to leave.\n\nDon t get me wrong   I adore that Pittsburgh is  a small  friendly city  but I m not fond of getting elbowed in the back as the guy behind me cuts his breakfast steak and eggs  nor knowing his guest gargled with Cool Mint Listerine this morning  or worse  didn t   . Yes  the tables are packed THAT close together. And
