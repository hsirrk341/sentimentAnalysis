I ve been informed by  a fellow Yelper that they are just closed for the season   I hope they re right   I find it strange they don t keep their phone number in service with  a recording and that they didn t cover the course up to protect it from weather  vandalism  etc. Either way   I can t wait to get my game on in the spring  
Ive pretty much been eating at various Kings  pretty regularly since  I was  a child when my parents would take my sister and  I into the Fox Chapel location often. Lately me and my girl have been visiting the Heidelburg location.  I love the food  it really tastes homemade  much like something  a grandmother would make  complete with gobs of butter and side dishes. Prices are low  selection is great  but dont expect fine dining by any means. \n\nService is hit or mis at pretty much al of them; if you have lunch at any Kings  you wil likely be waited on by  a sweet but sarcastic older lady who has been doing the waiting thing for 30 years and knows her game. Seek out this lady. My experience with the younger crowd at night isnt the same.\n\nIm in my 30s now  and very little has changed  other than the Fox Chapel location was remodeled about 10 years ago to look les like  a diner  which was  a big fail. Any girl  I meet has to enjoy Kings or she s out. 
Hoofah. 
 A gem. The coffe cups are mismatched  . The owner is thre feet away from me cooking. The sausage is made for them locally. And the food is frickin awesome.  I had the pancakes  my daughter had the sausage and eg sandwich. Cash only. Friendly service. 
OK  its Friday night and have about 70 minutes to eat. Driving by Papa J s and  W says  lets stop in and get  a quick dinner. \n\nAdvice host that we are in  a hurry. The host advised us it is  a 90 minute service. The place was crowded  we were seated at the last open table. However our waiter  Jason  said he wil do his best to get as out on time. We ordered our dinner immediately  with  a salad and  a glas of wine. In  a few minutes we had our wine  then in  a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade Italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving. for dipping. Yum \n\nJust as we were finishing our salads our dinners were delivered. Great job Jason  The Fettuccine Carbanara was very good;  a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta. In and out in 60 minutes. Now that is some good service. 
Ah  Steak  n Shake  you hit the spot after  a night of drinking. Open 24 hours  drive thru or dine in  with wonderful  cheap greasy burgers  chicken fingers  breakfast sandwiches  and shoestring fries. You re faster  and cheaper   than Eat  N Park. Plus your employees wear those adorable bow ties. Granted  if we were at  a fancy party   I might act like  I don t know you  but deep down inside you know  I heart you.

The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined  D     B in  .  .  .  . no  not Little Rock  but Dallas  To this day there are no  D    B s in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that  But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.\n\nThe one in Pittsburgh is the only one  I have ever been to.   Shucks  Probably not. Not  a Marin County scene  for sure. \n\nWHAT  A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH   I mis going to  D    B.

Lately  the Rock Bottom is hit or miss. The beers are always good and the Uppity Jagof IPA is one of the best India Pale Ales I ve ever tasted. The low point lately has been the food.  I wil never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla of the menu. That said   I ordered the lobster rol and when it arrived  the bread was as hard as  a brick and cold. The filling was okay  but the lobster flavor was masked by over spicing.  I suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the Rock Bottom. 
Thanks to the staf here\nFor being so friendly and\nCool with our whole mess*\n\n*rock bottom allowed our bachelorette party to eat and drink and hang after dave and busters orphaned us 
Although  I wouldn t travel out of my way to have dinner here  this is  a resturant that  I enjoy having  a meal at  when  I am in the Homestead water front. On al of my visits here  I have enjoyed the tempura shrimp. The dipping sauce are to die for. I ve found myself craveing the tempura shrimp  and the accompanying sauces. \n\nThe first time  I ever had dinner here was as  a birthday dinner with me and my big sister. So this resturant has sentimental value to me.  I attach eating here to having  a special night out in the Waterfront. \n\nBar Louie has some very flavorful and fun dishes for bar food  that is. 
 1 burger night on Tuesday. Ad ons more. 
Nope  
Really awesome food and amazing customer service.  I really enjoyed my experience here if  I am back in the area  I wil be certain to come back to this location. 
They make  a nice breakfast for les than the tip form dinner the night before. That s not bad  
 I was impressed. \n\nWent here for lunch. The seafood gumbo was tremendous.  I wasn t in the mood for more seafood so  I had the chicken blt on ciabatta bread. I m not sure what type of creamy sauce they put on the bread  but it was delicious. Wil go back again.\n\nThe food was reasonably priced for lunch. Dinner would obviously be more expensive but  I imagine it s worth the  . 
The lobster rolls were delicious  the blackened fish tacos were light and flaky  not to spicy and had  a nice salsa. The white sangria was very refreshing and not to alcoholic. The outdoor view of the river was really enjoyable and the service was quick. 
Great customer service  
 I have been looking for  3 years for good crab rangoon  -  I finally found it  We had boneles ribs that were absolutely wonderful. Definitely going back  
This place has some amazing homemade pierogies   I had never eaten anything besides the usual Mrs. T. s potato types and boy  was  I missing out  We stopped one night and got  a some potato/cheddar and some sauerkraut/potato. You can buy them hot or take them home cold. There is  a smal table outside to eat  but only standing room to order inside.\n\nThey had special order pierogies that sounded amazing  but they suggest  a  2 day advance order for those. They said sometimes they wil have leftover specialty ones for sale  but it al depends on the day. \n\nThey also have haluski  stuffed cabbage and other things that  I am looking forward to trying next time.

The  7 ounce house sirloin is the bomb   Nuf said. 
 I stopped by here two nights ago as part of  a night where  I would try thre different pizzas in the Bellevue/Avalon area.  I called my order in for an XL pizza ahead of time and was told that  I would have  a 15 minute wait until it was ready. Since  I only had  a general idea of where it was located  I ended up parking near it trying to locate it and then driving past it before finally locating it in  a smal strip mal right next to Lincoln Ave. There isn t to much to say about the inside of this pizza place except that they have  a counter up front with  a little bit of room to wait and no customer seating  not that this is  a bad thing.\n\nPizzas in general can be broken down into thre separate components: cheese  crust and sauce. This pizza actually had the least amount of cheese on it of al of the pizzas that we tried but ended up being my favorite which would be surprsing if you know me. The cheese was not that strong in flavor but the amount of it let it pair perfectly with the sauce which had  a nice spice profile  strong on the garlic and maybe some oregano   coming through it. The crust on this pizza was the thinnest of the bunch that we tried and was cooked nicely which also had  a little crisp which  I loved. \n\nThe bottom line for me is that  I would head back to  R    B s again in the future for pizza. It was easily the most expensive of the bunch that  I bought last night at  12.79 after tax for an XL but as the old adage goes \"You get what you pay for\" and if you like garlic then you should like this pizza. 
 A great little place. Delicious and affordable Italian food. Great salads and pasta. Try the pizza rolls  
Wow.
