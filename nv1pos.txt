Haven t seen the movie but loved your review.  I totally agre that  a homemaker is the most neglected person in Indian scenario 
Simply Fantastic. What an Outstanding Performance by Sridevi.

ENGLISH VINGLISH GOOD CHOICE BY SRIDEVI TO COME BACK.DECENT FLICK WITH COOL FUN.MUST WATCH FOR AL MOTHERS/HOUSE-WIVES. SRIDEVI IS AWESOME IN GIVING MINUTE EXPRESSIONS. 
Eager to se the movie  which got4 rating  as  I nvr saw tht to any movie recently. 
superb..very clean pic..must watch 
Average movie  looks like every one acting for oscar AWARD. There are lot many english spoken teachings in INdia. 
RUSSLES is the best. Why sridevi or director don know India got  1 week crash course also   i felt like Sridevi stil needs hindi classes before she learn english. It can be done in India before going to new york so cheap also we have discounts here as wel 
Not yet watched but wil watch for sure and loved your review and Priya Anand is from our place in NY so have to se her perofrmence and moreover waiting to se Sreedevi 
really loved the movie but my glamour dol looked old and whn camera is to close her nose and few features looked odd. 
Super movie such  a heart touching movie 
Welcome back Sridevi  
To good 
Nice movie 
Good movie. wel excellent come back by Sri devi. outstanding performance by beauty queen. 
Your commentary is better than the movie. Sridevi s performance was very good though  I cannot figure out why she adopted  a very old woman s voice in the beginning and she changes it to normal on arriving in USA.Like in many other indian movies  there is ample badmouthing of America-even to the extent of her asking why USA is THE United states Of America while there is no "THE" in front of India the "THE" in USA refers to the first  2 words-united states  The movie starts with  a good depiction of how she was not appreciated by her feisty teenage daughter and typical Indian husband  but  I was disappointed to se that neither the daughter apologizes nor the mother admonishes .Overal an above average movie and my wife a first generation immigrant  thoroughly enjoyed it. 
 A perfect review by Jeevi..Tht s  y we follow it regularly..This movie really wins 4/5..The situational songs  the feel in the movie  the actors performance  Sridevi  n especially the french guy    is wel taken..It s  a must watch for the whole family 
Sridevi did  a great job. However  the review is for the movie and the movie is worth 2.5 rating. Movie tries to give  a wrong message that knowing English is essential for getting respect. The fact is that if husband gives respect to wife  kids wil follow.  A homemaker is  a Doctor  Chef  Accounts Manger  Counselor  Home designer  and many more. No love and warmth is shown among the family members. And if learning English solves al the problems  it is foolish. But Sridevi  though  a granny looks like aunty has taken the movie by her stride and made the movie watchable 
 A Brilliant  n Sensible film..Finally     I understand the line tht why Ram Gopal Varma  r chowdary  r naidu loves Sridevi.Ths film is like finding  1 Gallon of chilled Mineral water in the long Desert after  a long Travel for water.Thanks for the Entire team of enlish vinglish. 
really nice movie  the acting by sri devi is very nice  in one scene she acted wel  I like that in the hotel she order for sandwich and water and coffe nice comeback by sri devi. 
Sweet  Emotional  Entertaining  thought provoking and Superb Comeback of Sridevi. 
It is  a good film 
Superb Movie
